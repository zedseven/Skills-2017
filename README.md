# Skills-2017
This is the file archive for the 2017 Skills Canada autonomous competition.

This competition involved picking up miniature foam footballs and delivering them to the other side of the arena - the problem spec is [here](http://www.skillsontario.com/index.php?p=download&file=552).

The robot was made using [VEX EDR Robotics kits](https://www.vexrobotics.com/276-2194.html), using [ROBOTC](http://www.robotc.net/) to write the program. The robot had a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) mounted with a [Pi Camera](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera) that interfaced with the VEX brain via a breadboard and basic digital signals.

We didn't score very well this year - this was the first year there was an autonomous competition, and we greatly underestimated the challenge.
